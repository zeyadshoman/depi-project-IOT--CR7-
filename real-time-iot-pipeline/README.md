# Real-Time IoT Data Pipeline

This project simulates IoT sensor data (temperature & humidity), processes it in batch and real-time, and visualizes insights through dashboards.

## Milestone 1: Data Simulation & Ingestion
- Python script generates random sensor data every 5 seconds.
- Data stored in CSV (and later streamed to Kafka/Azure Event Hub).

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas
- Apache Kafka / Azure Event Hub
- Azure Stream Analytics
- Power BI / Streamlit

## Team Roles
- Data Engineer: Simulation & ETL
- Cloud Engineer: Streaming & Cloud Setup
- Data Analyst: Dashboard & Reporting
